                <p class="text-small">Most of us have grown up being taught the importance of education. But why is
                    education important? Through your frustrating school years, you may have thought that it was a waste
                    of time, or was just something that you needed to do in order to get a job. Truth be told, however,
                    education goes so much beyond just getting a job and making your parents happy. In fact, it’s one of
                    the most powerful tools out there.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">What is Education?</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A childs right to education entails the right to learn. Yet, for too
                many children across the globe,
                schooling does not lead to learning.
                Over 600 million children and adolescents worldwide are unable to attain minimum proficiency levels in
                reading and mathematics, even though two thirds of them are in school. For out-of-school children,
                foundational skills in literacy and numeracy are further from grasp.
                This learning crisis the rift between the levels of learning children receive and those they, their
                communities and entire economies need hit a global scale even before the COVID-19 pandemic brought
                education systems to a halt.
                Around the world, children are deprived of education and learning for various reasons. Poverty remains
                one of the most obstinate barriers. Children living through economic fragility, political instability,
                conflict or natural disaster are more likely to be cut off from schooling as are those with
                disabilities, or from ethnic minorities. In some countries, education opportunities for girls remain
                severely limited.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Education in India</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a 'concurrent subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28
                states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the
                policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national
                policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies.
                State governments and local government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools
                and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing. Simultaneously the number and
                proportion managed by private bodies is growing. In 2005-6 83.13% of schools offering elementary
                education (Grades 1–8) were managed by government and 16.86% of schools were under private management
                (excluding children in unrecognised schools, schools established under the Education Guarantee Scheme
                and in alternative learning centers). Of those schools managed privately, one third are 'aided' and two
                thirds are 'unaided'. Enrolment in Grades 1–8 is shared between government and privately managed schools
                in the ratio 73:27. However in rural areas this ratio is higher (80:20) and in urban areas much lower
                (36:66).</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Lets Grow Together</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or
                preceptor after initiation. The education was delivered through Gurukula. The relationship between
                Guru and his Shishya (students /disciples) was very important part of the education.Takshasila (in
                modern-day Pakistan) is one of the example of ancient higher learning institute in India from possibly
                8th century BCE, however, it is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern
                sense, since teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and
                there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in a Taxila, in
                contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest university-system of
                education in the world in the modern sense of university. There all subjects were taught in the Pali
                language.
